Rule DSEL with Examples
Steve Kollmansberger and Martin Erwig (maintained by listofoptions, do not email main contributors!)


1. PREPARATIONS

Requires GHC 6.2 or 6.4.  You must adjust a setting in TypeGU.hs based on this!

The default setting assumes GHC 6.4.  If you are using 6.4, you don't need to make
any changes.  If, however, you are using GHC 6.2, open TypeGU.hs and comment out
lines 16 and 17.

In addition, glasgow extensions are required.  You can start the examples with

ghci -fglasgow-exts Type_.hs

where _ is the appropriate name, see below.

Other Haskell compilers/versions not tested. Your mileage may vary.

2. CORE FILES

The core DSEL files are:

NDSM.hs		Non-deterministic state monad
TypeGU.hs	Generic unification, substitution, and structures
TypeGT.hs	Rule DSEL, including lifting

3. EXAMPLES

TypeFV.hs	Determine if a variable is free in a lambda term
TypeFVSet.hs	Determine the set of free variables in a lambda term
TypeLam.hs	Type inference for lambda calculus
TypeChgTrad.hs	The first (par, arg, def) type change system
TypeChgMin.hs	The second (vchg) type change system
TypeChgPlus.hs	Concrete change suggestions


Supporting file:

TypeChg.hs	Foundation for all type change examples
